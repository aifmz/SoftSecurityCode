***Description of Real-World System***


An Education Suggestion Website is a for-profit massive open online course provider where a graduate/undergraduate/adults/teenagers or even kids can search for a topic to learn and different courses related to that topic with different instructors, ratings, and description are
viewed to them in order to choose the best one to enroll in. 

The enroller can communicate easily with the constructor about courses’ topics and other issues. All details are described by the following:
Each enroller has a unique ID and a profile. The profile includes the enroller’s name -his first name at least-, email, gender, data of birth, login password, may have a photo uploaded, and a list of enrolled
courses that enroller have been enrolled into. Each instructor has unique ID, and profile. The profile indicates the instructor’s specialization, name, list of published courses, list of reviews about the instructor, and an instructor can have more than one specialization.

Each course has course number, an instructor, given specialization, course hours, course content, number of enrollers, order among its specialization, and rating out of 5.
A new Enroller can sign up to the system -by providing full name, email and password- to be able to enroll different courses or browse courses.
